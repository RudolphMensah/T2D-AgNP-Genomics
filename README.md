# ðŸ§¬ Green Synthesis of AgNP-Phytochemical Complexes for Type 2 Diabetes: A Genomic Analysis

This project is part of a doctoral research simulation exploring the therapeutic potential of **silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)** synthesized from antidiabetic **phytochemicals**. The goal is to assess their combined impact on molecular pathways implicated in **Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)**.

## ðŸ§ª Key Objectives

- Simulate efficiency of AgNP synthesis from 10 phytochemicals
- Evaluate their effects on five critical T2D-related biological pathways
- Visualize outcomes and perform correlation analysis
- Rank compounds based on therapeutic impact and synthesis efficiency

## ðŸ“Š Tools Used

- R (tidyverse, corrplot, reshape2)
- Simulated data generation
- Visualizations: bar plots, boxplots, correlation matrix

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This simulation provides a foundation for a future **wet-lab and genomic validation** phase.
- Designed to align with research on **diabetes pathways**, **green nanomedicine**, and **functional genomics**.
